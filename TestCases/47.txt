Like the Simple knot, the Kelvin starts with the tie lying inside out resulting in an inverted tail. This knot produces a lithe and tidy knot similar in size to the Four-in-Hand but slightly fuller and more angular.The Kelvin necktie knot is named after Lord Kelvin(William Thomson, 1824-1907) a mathematical physicist who contributed to the theory of knots in relation to atomic structure.
