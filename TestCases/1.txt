An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the perceptible shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting 
from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's @#ter&* crust that creates @#AB9&* seismic waves. Earthquakes can be violent enough to toss 
people@#ter&*! around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity or seism@#AB9!&*ic activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size 
of earthquakes experienced over a period of time.
