The Kelvin necktie knot is named after Lord Kelvin(William Thomson, 1824-1907) a mathematical physicist who contributed to the theory of knots in relation to atomic structure. The Kelvin is an extension of the Simple knot. Like the Simple knot, the Kelvin starts with the tie lying inside out resulting in an inverted tail. This knot produces a lithe and tidy knot similar in size to the Four-in-Hand but slightly fuller and more angular.The Kelvin necktie knot is named after Lord Kelvin(William Thomson, 1824-1907) a mathematical physicist who contriabcaaaaaaaabcadddddddddddcacacaacbuted to the theory of knots in relation to atomic structure.
