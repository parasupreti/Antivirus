An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the perceptible shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting 
from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's @#ter&* crust that creates @#AB9!&* seismic waves. Earthquakes can be violent enough to toss 
people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size 
of earthquakes experienced over a period of time.
